Nim

######by Evan Allan and Brian Decker

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Works on Linux/Mac/Windows

To run, just run the "Nim-EvanAllan_BrianDecker.jar"
Depending on your operating system, you may need to set
the executable bit to give it permissions to be executed. (Only Linux and Mac I think?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###How to Play:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use projectiles fired by pressing and releasing the left mouse button to 'draw'
lines that slash out spheres in the triangle pattern. 

Lines can only be slashed out horizontally.

To slash one sphere you shoot two projectiles at the same sphere.

To slash out multiple spheres, shoot a projectile a sphere, and the second at a sphere
0 or more spheres away to the left or right of the lne draw point.

Sorry for large file size, cross-platform graphics libraries tend to do that.
